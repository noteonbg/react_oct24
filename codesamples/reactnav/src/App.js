/*


In React Router, several key terminologies are important to understand how routing works. Here are the main ones:

1. Router
   - The top-level component that manages routing. The most common type is `BrowserRouter`, which uses the HTML5 history API to keep your UI in sync with the URL.

2. Route
   - Defines a mapping between a URL path and a component. Each `Route` specifies a path and the component that should be rendered when the path is matched.

   javascript
   <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
   

3. Routes
   - A container that groups multiple `Route` components. It checks the current URL and renders the first child `Route` that matches.

4. Link
   - A component used to create navigable links to different routes. It prevents full page reloads and keeps the app in a single-page application (SPA) context.

   javascript
   <Link to="/about">About</Link>
   

5. NavLink
   - Similar to `Link`, but with additional styling capabilities. It can apply an active style when the link is active (i.e., when the route it points to is currently matched).

6. useNavigate
   - A hook that allows programmatic navigation. It provides a function to navigate to different routes in response to events.

   javascript
   const navigate = useNavigate();
   navigate('/about');
   

7. useLocation
   - A hook that returns the current location object, which contains information about the current URL, including pathname, search, and hash.

8. useParams
   - A hook used to access URL parameters. It allows you to extract values from the URL, typically used in dynamic routes.

   javascript
   const { id } = useParams();
   

9. useRouteMatch
   - A hook that returns information about how a `<Route>` path matches the current URL. 
   It's useful for conditional rendering based on the current route.

10. Redirect
   - A component used to navigate to a different route programmatically.
    This is often used after a user action or if certain conditions are met.

11. Nested Routes
   - Routes that are defined within other routes, allowing for a 
   hierarchical structure. This enables more complex layouts and routes.

12. History
   - An object that keeps track of the browser's session history. The Router interacts with the history to keep the UI in sync with the URL.
