FastAPI WebSocket:

The FastAPI backend has a WebSocket endpoint (/ws/machine-status) that simulates sending machine status updates every 2 seconds. The status can be "Operational", "Under Maintenance", or "Stopped".
React Frontend:

The React component MachineStatus connects to the WebSocket endpoint and listens for messages. When a message is received, it updates the displayed status.
Real-Time Updates:

As the FastAPI server sends updates, they appear in the browser in real time.

1. Real-Time Communication
WebSockets allow for instant communication between the client and server. This is particularly useful for applications that require live updates, such as chat applications, online gaming, financial tickers, and monitoring dashboards in domains like manufacturing.

2. Full-Duplex Communication
WebSockets support full-duplex communication, meaning both the client and server can send messages to each other simultaneously. This contrasts with traditional HTTP requests, where the client must request information from the server.

3. Reduced Latency
With WebSockets, once a connection is established, messages can be sent and received with minimal latency. This is crucial for applications that need immediate feedback, such as collaborative editing tools or real-time data feeds.

4. Efficient Resource Usage
WebSockets maintain a single, persistent connection rather than opening and closing multiple HTTP connections for each interaction. This reduces overhead and improves resource utilization, leading to better performance and scalability.

5. Lower Bandwidth Consumption
Because WebSockets use a single connection, they can reduce the amount of data sent over the network. Unlike traditional polling methods, which require frequent requests, WebSockets send updates only when there are changes, minimizing unnecessary traffic.

6. Event-Driven Architecture
WebSocket connections can be event-driven, allowing the server to push data to clients when specific events occur. This is beneficial in scenarios like monitoring machine statuses in manufacturing, where immediate updates are critical.

7. Cross-Platform Compatibility
WebSockets are supported by most modern browsers and can be used with various programming languages and frameworks on the server side, making them versatile for web applications across different platforms.

8. Use Cases in Manufacturing
Machine Monitoring: Receive real-time updates on machine status, production rates, and alerts for any issues.
Collaboration: Facilitate communication between team members working on the factory floor or in remote locations.
Data Visualization: Display real-time analytics and metrics on dashboards for quick decision-making.



WebSockets are ideal for applications that require real-time,
 bi-directional communication. 
 By using WebSockets, developers can create more 
 interactive and responsive applications,
  enhancing user experience and efficiency in various domains,
